          Mochi are small, sweet Japanese cakes made with glutinous rice flour
          (mochiko). They have a soft, chewy outer layer and a deliciously
          sticky filling made of sweetened red bean paste. Freezing the red bean
          paste before you use it is optional but it does make the process
          easier.

          <li>1 cup glutinous rice flour</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon green tea powder (matcha)</li>
          <li>1 cup water</li>
          <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>

        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
          <li>
            Wrap red bean paste in aluminum foil and place in the freezer until
            solid, at least 1 hour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mix glutinous rice flour and green tea powder thoroughly in a
            microwave-safe bowl.
          </li>
          <li>Stir in water, then sugar; mix until smooth.</li>
          <li>
            Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave for 3 minutes 30
            seconds
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, remove red bean paste from the freezer and divide into 8
            equal balls. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove rice flour mixture from the microwave. Stir and heat,
            covered, for another 15 to 30 seconds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dust a work surface with cornstarch. Roll about 2 tablespoons of hot
            rice flour mixture into a ball. Flatten the ball and place one ball
            of frozen red bean paste in the center. Pinch and press the dough
            around the bean paste until completely covered.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sprinkle with additional cornstarch and place mochi, seam-side down,
            in a paper muffin liner to prevent sticking.
          </li>
          <li>Repeat Step 6 to make remaining mochi.</li>
          <li>Enjoy!</li>
