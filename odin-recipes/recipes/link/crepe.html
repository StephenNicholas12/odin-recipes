          Using this simple 'crepe cake' technique, you can turn any of your
          favorite cake fillings into visually stunning, multi-layered
          masterpieces. By the way, I say this is simple, not fast, as it does
          take some time to make and stack all those crepes, but once you get
          rolling, it goes pretty quickly. Use the ingredient amounts only as a
          guide, as crepe sizes and filling amounts will vary. Dust with
          powdered sugar and garnish with fresh strawberries.

          <li>
            Pour eggs, flour, sugar, salt, oil, milk, and vanilla extract into a
            blender. Blend, starting on low speed and finishing on high, until
            combined. Refrigerate batter for at least 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scoop strawberry jam into a saucepan. Rinse out jar with water and
            pour into the saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and stir.
            Simmer for 1 minute, remove from heat, and stir. Let cool to room
            temperature.
          </li>
          <li>
            Brush some butter over a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour in
            1/4 cup batter; tilt pan to coat evenly. Cook until crepes bubble
            and brown, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking sheet.
            Repeat with remaining batter, buttering the pan between crepes. Let
            cool completely before stacking, at least 15 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine mascarpone cheese, cream, sugar, and vanilla extract in a
            bowl. Whisk together until stiff peaks form.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lay a crepe onto a large plate. Spoon on 2 or 3 tablespoons of the
            cream mixture, spreading it almost to the edge. Swirl in some
            strawberry jam. Transfer finished crepe onto a flat serving plate.
            Repeat with remaining crepes, cream, and jam. Center each crepe over
            the previous one in a stack. Gently press on a final plain crepe to
            finish.
          </li>
          <li>
            Refrigerate until completely chilled before cutting and serving.
